```

###Part 2 
Create an HTML/PDF document that samples 100 values from a log-normal distribution (say, mu=1, sigma=.25)

```{r sample}
x = rlnorm(1000, meanlog=1, sdlog=.25)
```


Create a histogram of the distribution and the distribution on the log scale; report the mean and variance of the sample in line in the text.

```{r histogram}
hist(x,200)
hist(log(x),200)
```
