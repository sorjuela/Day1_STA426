```

###Part 2 
**Create an HTML/PDF document that samples 100 values from a log-normal distribution (say, mu=1, sigma=.25)**


```{r sample}
x = rlnorm(1000, meanlog=1, sdlog=.25)
```


**Create a histogram of the distribution and the distribution on the log scale**


```{r histogram}
hist(x,200)
hist(log(x),200)
```


**Report the mean and variance of the sample in line in the text: **

So the mean is `r mean(x)` and the variance is `r var(x)`
